BEFORE DEPLOYMENT

1. Put middleware.ts into /src/app (wrong) instead of /src (correct)
2. Problems with requests to the server (because I didn't have much experience with requests before)
3. Problems with db (I wasn`t checking for uniques)

4. Problems with google speech api.
Why: It doesn't work with some files because of the service limitations.
Solutions: use some more speech api services or convert files into supported encodings.

AFTER DEPLOYMENT

5. Needed to create new migrations for new db the vercel postgres.
6. Problems with google speech api, again. 
Needed to pass the value of a key json file as a string,
parse it into an object and then use it while creating speechClient variable.
During development I was using a path to that file.
