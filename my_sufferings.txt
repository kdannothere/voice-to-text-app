1. Put middleware.ts into /src/app (wrong) instead of /src (correct)
2. Problems with requests to the server (because I didn't have much experience with requests before)
3. Problems with db (I wasn`t checking for uniques)

4. Problems with google speech api.
Why: It doesn't work with some files because of the service limitations.
Solutions: use some more speech api services or convert files into supported encodings.
